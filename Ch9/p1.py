# dictionary meant to hold the average daily temperature for each day of the week,
# the day, and the dayâ€™s average temperature. The function should add the temperature
# to the dictionary only if does not already contain a temperature for that day.
# The function should return the resulting dictionary, whether or not it is updated.
